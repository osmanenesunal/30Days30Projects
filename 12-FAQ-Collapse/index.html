          We use Royal Mail for UK Standard Tracked Delivery and UK Express
          Delivery. You will be given a two hour delivery window via text and/or
          email. You can track your order at any time using Royal Mail Track and

        <h3 class="faq-title">What happens if I miss my delivery?​</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Whilst you will be kept informed of your delivery window, we do know
          that sometimes you might just miss it! If this does happen, you will
          be informed by email and may also receive a calling card. You will be
          able to arrange a redelivery via email or by following instructions on
          your calling card. We do recommend downloading the Royal Mail app,
          where you can manage your delivery, including adding a safe place,
          leaving with a neighbour or collecting from your local Post Office.
